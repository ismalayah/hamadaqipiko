Jimmy matched with both Jessica and Chelsea in the pods and they enjoyed a lengthy dating process before Jimmy finally made up his mind. Fans have plenty of theories as to why, but Jimmy chose Chelsea, and Jessica was not pleased when she found out. She gave Jimmy a piece of her mind and, in the process, promised him that he would “choke” when he saw what she looked like in the real world.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>That moment finally arrived mid-way through the season, and it was a doozy. Jessica was right about Jimmy’s reaction to seeing her in person, and — while he didn’t actually choke — she certainly gave him plenty to think about.</p><h2 id=h-what-happens-when-jimmy-sees-jessica-for-the-first-time data-injectable=false>What happens when Jimmy sees Jessica for the first time?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Love is Blind season 6 dropped the first portion of its season on Feb. 14, breaking from its typical release schedule in several ways. A full six episodes hit Netflix all at once, in an increase from a usual season’s four to five, and the show has shifted from a late-week release to one in the middle.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Regardless of the slight increase in episodes, however, it took weeks for the moment everyone was waiting for to finally come about. Jimmy and Jessica didn’t meet in person until episode 10 and their conversation was telling. While many people expected Jessica to shoot her shot with Jimmy, the 29-year-old was instead restrained and respectful. Jimmy? Not so much.</p><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Jimmy was clearly taken with Jessica’s good looks, and — paired with his ceaseless arguments with Chelsea —&nbsp;it seemed clear that he was doubting his decision. He didn’t outright say as much, but he was very complimentary of Jessica and at one point even admitted to feeling “nervous” around her. Far more egregious was his confession that “in my reality, you’re my number one still.” While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">engaged to Chelsea</a>, he informed Jessica that she remains his number one pick. Swell.</p><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=false>It was a wild admission, and one that Jessica gracefully swept past. She turned the conversation in a much more appropriate direction, noting through tears that she wants nothing but happiness for Jimmy and Chelsea, and the conversation ended soon after. Its hard to say if that will be then end of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy and Jessica’s interactions</a>, but for now the conversation leaves them in an interesting spot. It will be even more interesting when Jimmy’s admisson inevitably <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">crops up in the reunion</a>, leaving fans with even more reason to look forward to the March 13 episode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yrtcymsGarlZrAbrbErKqim5FivK95y6itnmWZqHqjuMinm2adqKW5orXNnpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
