  On Tuesday, Fox stepped out in a monochromatic brown look that consisted of a chocolate-colored tank tucked into a matching distressed leather maxiskirt with a flared bottom. Black patent-leather slouchy stiletto boots peeked out from under the shin-length hem, and Fox kept her accessories to a minimum."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Black patent-leather slouchy stiletto boots peeked out from under the shin-length hem, and Fox kept her accessories to a minimum. Her on-trend seasonal crimson manicure coordinated with her fiery 'do, and she opted for a simple makeup look that included a shimmery eye shadow, feathered lashes, and a glossy pout.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The book contains a collection of poems about relationships, some of which detail her life and others that she described as "allegorical" to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. In two of the anthology's pieces, Fox writes about a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>miscarriage</a> that she and fiancé Machine Gun Kelly experienced, and during a recent interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Good Morning America,</a> Fox opened up about that difficult time in her life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I’ve never been through anything like that in my life," she said. "I have three kids, so it was very difficult for both of us and it sent us on a very wild journey together and separately … trying to navigate, ‘What does this mean?’ and ‘Why did this happen?’”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also told reporter Kayna Whitworth&nbsp;that some of the pieces depict <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>past abusive relationships</a>, while some of her work didn't make it into the final product because "it is too much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wrote a lot of things that didn't make it because I was like, 'This is maybe for God's eyes only,'" she explained. "Some of it is too much when you're a known person. If I had the freedom of just being a poet, and people not really wanting to dig too much into my personal life, I would have included more entries like that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6emqZdm7y5ecyopaibmKe8rq3ToppmmqKkxK95y56YraCVp3q0t8irq2aekaG5brvUrZ2irF1tgHqFk2po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
