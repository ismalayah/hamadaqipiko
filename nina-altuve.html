Because of this very reason, unfortunately, there is little to no information about where Erin works and what cases she handles as a bio analyst. It is also true that her professional career is often overshadowed because of her fame through her husband. Although there is no information on whether Nina started her professional career as a bio analyst right after graduating, she got her bioanalytics degree from one of the prestigious universities of Venezuela.</p><p>So, Nina may be helping the research departments to enhance their expertise on living organisms and natural resources management, which is what bio analysts do. Hence, Nina is more engaged in her mother’s duties than her job as a bio analyst because of her devotion to her children and family.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=relationship-status><span id=Relationship_Status><strong>Relationship Status</strong></span></h3><p>Regarding her relationship status, Nina is a happily married woman who met her husband, José Altuve, when she was still in high school. Nina was head over heels for being with José, and he believed their love was confirmed when they were dating at such a young age. Because of this very reason, they decided to make their relationship permanent even before graduating from high school and tied their wedding knot when Nina was just 14 years old while José was a 16-year-old boy.</p><p>Nina and José decided to take their relationship to the next level after marrying all these years and welcoming their first child, Melanie A. Altuve, in October 2016 after the announcement of Nina being pregnant that same year. She lives with her family in a Houston house, which they moved to around 2020.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=height-weight-and-physical-appearances><span id=Height_Weight_and_Physical_Appearances><strong>Height, Weight, and Physical Appearances</strong></span></h3><p>Nina is 5 feet 4 inches tall, and her weight is unavailable.
