Here’s more on that, plus how <a href=#>the British star</a> felt during her comeback One Night Only concert and what she loves most about the Christmas holiday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Adele-on-the-carpet-at-the-BRIT-Awards.jpg><h2 id=h-adele-said-her-tv-special-was-overwhelming>Adele said her TV special was ‘overwhelming’</h2><p id=par-3_37>Following the release of 30, Adele spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Audacy’s The Julia Show</a>&nbsp;about performing again in her&nbsp;<a href=#>Adele One Night Only</a>&nbsp;special and what was going through her mind as she took the stage again after six years away.</p><p id=par-4_62>“It was so overwhelming,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she admitted.</a> “When I was going up to my sound check … there was lots of security and like park personnel everywhere. And I remember saying to my driver, ‘What’s all of this? This is gonna get in the way of people coming to the show and stuff.’ He was like, ‘This is all closed off for you.’</p><p id=par-5_85>“It was such a big, bloody production. It looked beautiful. It was wild. It was definitely overwhelming … My son was there, which literally made me a nervous wreck. I was terrified about having him there but also so happy about it. The intimacy of it, that felt really good. I think I probably would’ve thrown up had it been thousands of people. It was definitely an out-of-this-world setting, that’s for sure. I felt like a bloody movie star up there, I couldn’t believe it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Photo-of-Adele-during-her-One-Night-Only-concert-in-Los-Angeles.jpg><p id=par-6_12>So what did Adele’s son, Angelo, think of his mother’s performance?</p><p id=par-7_79>“He was definitely excited about the whole thing,” she said. “He knew that obviously it was my show once I was up there, but I still think he thought someone else was going to be doing something. He was very cute afterwards. He came and said well done, and gave me a cuddle and a kiss. I don’t think he was blown away or anything by it, I’m just his mum. He’s so chill, it’s wild, because I’m not.”</p><h2 id=h-the-singer-reveals-more-about-30-and-shares-what-she-likes-best-about-the-christmas-holiday>The singer reveals more about ’30,’ and shares what she likes best about the Christmas holiday</h2><p id=par-8_28>Adele revealed that her highly-anticipated album was initally supposed to come out in 2020 but the pandemic changed things, however, she’s happy with how everything turned out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_115>“I was hoping the album would come out last year. Everyone’s plans got halted last year. I was sitting on it for what feels like an eternity,” she explained, adding, “There were some things that I couldn’t get finalized because of the pandemic, like the strings and orchestras and stuff like that, so it definitely wouldn’t have been the album I’m putting out now because of that, and I’m glad I got to do that. It was nice to get to know my album inside out, because normally when it’s done and it’s mixed, then kind of buildup to get it out straight away, so it was definitely in the end quite a nice thing.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_21>And because 30 was released a few weeks before Christmas, Adele was asked what she enjoys most about the holiday.</p><p id=par-11_32>“I love Christmas T.V.,” she shared. “I love all the stuff on broadcast television. The best lineup of T.V. over Christmas. It’s so nostalgic. I always get so excited to watch T.V.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSupbHLnmSsoJGnsrR5xZqtqKqZqbJuwMeipaBlk52%2Fqr%2FTppisZpipuq17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
