For some reason, he decided to call her out and brag about his many high-emission cars and for her email address so that he could send her a list of them all. Her hilarious “<a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=3b48565a57575f5258505e555e495c427b5c5e4f5a57525d5e15585456>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>” reply prompted him to try to top her which led him to post a video where he displays two pizza boxes that he had no intention of recycling. He made it a point to say that.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>What also happened was those pizza boxes clued the Romanian police into his location because prosecutors had secured a warrant for his arrest for human trafficking, rape, and forming an organized crime group. He snitched on himself and he’s kicking his own butt about right now, but not without the help of Greta herself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>this is what happens when you don’t recycle your pizza boxes</p>— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) <a href=#>December 30, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>How it all went down evokes a very satisfying feeling knowing that after all his bullying, being led away in handcuffs was the result. Obviously, this can be compared to many things but a perfect likening is to that of Patrizia Reggiani who was convicted of the murder of her ex-husband, Maurizio Gucci. But before her downfall, there is an interesting twist in House of Gucci where Patrizia, played by Lady Gaga, arranges the arrest of her husband’s uncle, played by Al Pacino.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Andrew Tate Greta Thunberg <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OKDGotZRjD</a></p>— Joey Monda (@joeymonda) <a href=#>December 29, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Worthy of being considered a work of art, this comedic fan has Greta’s response to Tate framed and hung on display in the world’s most prestigious museum, the Louvre in Paris.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: Greta Thunberg response to Andrew Tate has been hung in the Louvre. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DTvkKB9iqD</a></p>— Dr Harold News (@DrHaroldNews) <a href=#>December 28, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=80 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>The punches keep coming in and a reference to Scooby-Doo is definitely on time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>You're welcome <a href=#>#AndrewTate</a> <a href=#>#AndrewTaint</a> <a href=#>#AndrewTatearrested</a> <a href=#>#GretaThunberg</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mJBsCqbq0Q</a></p>— Koi (@TechnoKoi) <a href=#>December 30, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>As far as bragging about how many cars he has to drive, none of them are any good to him now.
