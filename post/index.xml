This is one of those Identikit movies, assembled out of familiar parts from other, better movies. It begins at the end of "Halloween II," when the monster was burned up in the hospital parking lot, but it's not still another retread of the invincible monster. In fact, the monster is forgotten, except for a lab technician who spends the whole movie sifting through his ashes.</description></item><item><title>Inside the Craziest Movie Sex Scene of the Year</title><link>/midsommar-inside-the-craziest-movie-sex-scene-of-the-year.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/midsommar-inside-the-craziest-movie-sex-scene-of-the-year.html</guid><description>Ari Aster’s daylight-soaked nightmare Midsommar is never coy about the inevitability of its twisted fairy-tale ending. Quite the opposite: it lays out every step of our impending descent into pastoral hell in vivid, colorfully stitched pictures on quilts, long before the outsiders we follow into a quaint Swedish commune understand what they mean. Without context, they only see a girl becoming smitten, bright red hearts in her eyes. They don’t know they’ll soon be privy to a deliciously fucked-up courtship—or that it’ll climax in one of the most transcendently insane sex scenes in recent memory, as hypnotic and unsettling as it is just straight-up funny.</description></item><item><title>5 letter words starting with RO Wordle Game Help</title><link>/5-letter-words-starting-with-ro-wordle-game-help.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/5-letter-words-starting-with-ro-wordle-game-help.html</guid><description>Wordle‘s word of the day changes every day and there may be times when you may feel thrown off.

Shot by the great Roger Deakins, regular cinematographer for the Coen brothers, the movie is drenched in rain and drained of color. Aspects of "Prisoners" are effective, but for the most part it's rather ridiculous (despite the fact that it clearly wants to be taken super-seriously), and there's an overwrought quality to much of the acting.</description></item><item><title>The Weeknd Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</title><link>/the-weeknd-3.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-weeknd-3.html</guid><description>Net Worth $300 Million Name The Weeknd Date of Birth 16 February 1990 Age 33 Years Old Gender Male The Weeknd Net Worth $300 Million
