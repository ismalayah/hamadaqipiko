Formerly ranked No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking, his career is highlighted by 14 PGA Tour wins including a major title at the 2017 PGA Championship and the 2017 FedExCup. Thomas is also only 1 of 4 players in PGA Tour history with 14 victories before his 28th birthday, joining Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller and Tiger Woods.</p><p>In 2018, Justin was just the 21st player to ever reach #1 in the Official World Golf Rankings following his WGC win in Memphis. His breakout season came in 2016-17 with five of his PGA TOUR wins, including the PGA Championship, 12 top 10 finishes and, ultimately, the FedEx Championship. His other victories came at the CIMB Classic, Sentry Tournament of Champions, Sony Open in Hawaii and Dell Technologies Championship. At the Sony Open, Thomas became the youngest player to shoot 59 on the PGA TOUR and also broke the TOUR’s 72-hole scoring record by a stroke.</p><p>Justin played collegiate golf for the Alabama Crimson Tide. There he became one of the storied program’s most decorated athletes, being named Phil Mickelson Freshman of the Year, Jack Nicklaus Player of the Year, the Haskins Award Winner as the most outstanding player in collegiate and amateur golf, and capped his collegiate career by helping the Crimson Tide win their first National Championship.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-age></span> Justin Thomas Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born Justin Louis Thomas on April 29, 1993 in Louisville, Kentucky.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-parents></span> Justin Thomas Parents<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Thomas is the son of Mike and Jani Thomas. His father, Mike Thomas, has been the head professional at the Harmony Landing Country Club in Goshen, Kentucky, since 1990.</p><p>Golf was in Justin’s lineage, too. His father was a longtime P.G.A. of America professional who toiled on the mini tours before turning to teaching. His paternal grandfather, Paul, was the head professional at Zanesville Country Club in Ohio for more than 25 years and played in the United States Open.</p><p>From the first time Justin picked up a golf club at 18 months old, golf has been an obsession for him. As soon as he could walk, Justin would tag along whenever his father would practice.</p><p>“I remember one time him grabbing at my clubs and saying, ‘I want to hit one,’” Mike Thomas told The New York Times. “He gripped the club cross-handed and started whacking balls. From that point on, all he wanted to do was hit balls. His mom would tee them up, and he’d hit them.”</p><p>His father taught his the fundamentals of golf, but he was cautious about pushing him too hard. Most of their lessons would last 10 or 15 minutes, in part because Mike Thomas had a busy schedule teaching and competing, but also because he did not want to be overbearing.</p><p>“I’ve seen it done wrong so many times. It was more important that we were friends than he was a good player,” Mike Thomas said. “I’d watch him hit a few balls and ask him what he thought was causing the ball to do what it did. I’d tell him, What are you going to do, call me when you’re on the 15th hole of a tournament? Because of that, he knows his own game.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-family></span> Justin Thomas Family<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Is Justin Thomas an only child? The professional golfer is an only child. For those who asked us, “Does Justin Thomas have siblings?” You have the answer, he does not have siblings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-wife></span> Justin Thomas Wife<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Is Justin Thomas married? The golfer is engaged to Jillian Wisniewski. Justin announced his engagement to longtime girlfriend Jillian Wisniewski during his appearance on the No Laying Up podcast in November 2021.</p><p>The interview was almost over when Justin started going into his holiday plans and offhandedly mentioned he’ll be tying the knot with Wisniewski.</p><p>“We have a place in Nashville we’re going to go for Thanksgiving,” he said. “Me and my new fiancé, Jill, her family’s going.”</p><p>Asked if their engagement had previously been made public, Thomas laughed and said no.</p><p>According to PGATour.com, Thomas and Wisniewski have been dating since around 2016. She is a graduate of the University of Kentucky and has worked at an ad agency in Chicago. Wisniewski is close friends with Jordan Spieth’s wife, Annie Verret, and Rickie Fowler’s wife, Allison Stokke.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-wedding></span> Justin Thomas Wedding<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During his appearance on the No Laying Up podcast, Justin Thomas did not mention a date for the wedding. The professional golfer joked that his foreseeable future would be, “Probably just her doing a lot of wedding planning and me just chillin’ and playing golf.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-caddie></span> Justin Thomas Caddie<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Who Is Justin Thomas’ Caddie? In Oct. 2021, Justin and his caddie Jimmy Johnson decided to part ways after a successful six-year partnership. Thomas and Johnson had been together since 2015 when he joined the tour and just two years later, he won his first major title at the PGA Championship and the FedEx Cup. The pair won 14 PGA Tour events as a team.</p><p>“Jimmy and I had an incredible run of six years together but we have agreed to go our separate ways,” Justin said in a statement. “I 100% did not fire him, as Jimmy came to me after the Ryder Cup and told me he has decided to pursue other opportunities. I have nothing but respect for Jimmy and his wife Jen and I’ll always appreciate all the success and times we had together, I wish him all the best.”</p><p>It was announced that Jim “Bones” Mackay, who famously caddied for Phil Mickelson for 25 years, will be Thomas’ new caddie for the 2021/2022 PGA Tour season. Mackay, who had been working as an on-course reporter for NBC and Golf Channel since 2017, has caddied for Thomas before. In 2018, Johnson suffered an injury so Mackay filled into caddie for Thomas at the Sony Open. Also in 2020, Mackay carried for Thomas at the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational when he won the tournament by 3 shots.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-net-worth></span> Justin Thomas Net Worth<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Thomas’ net worth is estimated to be $35 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-career-earnings></span> Justin Thomas Career Earnings<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Thomas has earned $46,344,895 in career earnings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-witb></span> Justin Thomas WITB<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Thomas WITB 2022, <strong>Driver</strong>: Titleist TSi2 (9.5°, Mitsubishi Diamana ZF 60 TX shaft). <strong>3-wood</strong>: Titleist TS3 (15°, A1 setting, Mitsubishi Tensei AV Raw Blue 85 TX shaft). <strong>5-wood</strong>: Titleist 915 FD (18°, Fujikura Motore Speeder VC 9.2 Tour Spec X shaft). <strong>Irons</strong>: Titleist T100 (4); Titleist 620 MB, (5-9, True Temper Dynamic Gold Tour Issue X100 shafts). <strong>Wedges</strong>: Titleist Vokey Design Raw SM7 (46° set to 47.5°, 52° set to 52.5°, 56° set to 57°); Titleist Vokey Design Raw SM6 (60° set to 60.5°, True Temper Dynamic Gold X100 Tour Issue shafts on 46, True Temper Dynamic Gold Tour Issue S400 shafts on 52-60). <strong>Putter</strong>: Scotty Cameron X5 Tour Prototype. <strong>Golf Ball</strong>: Titleist Pro V1x. <strong>Grips</strong>: Golf Pride Tour Velvet Cord (woods, irons and wedges); SuperStroke Pistol GT Tour (putter). <strong>Shoes</strong>: FootJoy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-height></span> Justin Thomas Height<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Thomas stands at a height of 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) and weighs 160 lb (73 kg).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-thomas-instagram></span> Justin Thomas Instagram<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Thomas’ Instagram handle is @justinthomas34.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKlqMGquoytn6ilkah6uLXFnmSnnaRixLC%2B06FknJmimrKzecSaqaehnpzAbsPIrZlmnpGitq3FjKygm6SZo7S0edKiqq2domK1prXGoatmpZGnv6qxw2aunpyUnruoecOonmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
