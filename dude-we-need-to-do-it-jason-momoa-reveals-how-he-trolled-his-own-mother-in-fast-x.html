While other celebrities are presumably on a waiting list to join the Illuminati dating app, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a></strong> decided it was important to play a joke on the woman who gave him life, in the form of a car in <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast X</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Momoa has been getting a lot of attention for his turn in the latest movie about cars, explosions, and “family.” Some are even saying he steals the movie with his portrayal of Dante, son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes. Since Vin Diesel’s Dom dispatched with Dante’s father, Dante wants to show him what family is all about.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Screen Rant</a>, Momoa showed just how he feels about his real family. Apparently, he wanted a lavender color car for his character, but no one else seemed to be into that idea at all. Here’s how Momoa put it:</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>“They weren’t that keen on letting me have a lavender car. I think Neil was like, ‘No, we’re not doing lavender.’ I’m like, ‘Dude, we need to do it. I want it lavender.’ And they budged.”</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>When Aquaman wants a lavender car, you get it for him. Wait until you hear why, though. Honestly, the commitment to a prank here is inspiring.</p><p>“The whole thing behind lavender is that my mother absolutely despises that color, and I adore that color. I use it to just kind of get under my mother’s skin, and it just makes us laugh. I call it Yaya Lavender, and then just having all my nails done that way, I’m excited for her to see me in full pinks and purples. It will just make her cringe, so that gives me a lot of joy.”</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>There is a special joy in trolling your own mother. I trolled mine by turning my back on religion. It’s still going on!</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>The lavender car really does help cement Momoa’s character and provides a nice contrast to Dom’s ostentatious muscle car obsession. Momoa is getting rave reviews for his off-kilter performance in the film, with some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comparing him to another iconic film villain</a>: The Joker.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>Momoa also made sure to pay close attention to Dante’s wardrobe, revealing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he had “a lot of ideas”</a> about what he wanted for the character.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>“I really was inspired by pastel colors. I wanted something that was warm and inviting. And then when you got close to him, you were just like, ‘That’s the devil, and the devil tricked me.’ That was kind of the whole idea.”</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>Fast X is in theaters now. No word on whether Momoa and his mama have buried the hatchet yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8Oum55lp5p6r7HEnWStp12ZvG6102ahmqufo3quu8yomGaqlauyorjSZp%2Bor12dsm7A0aijpZ2UYrWqv4yorqdlnaTBqbHRZqCnZZaWwLV512g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
