"I've always been kind of insecure about how I look without makeup," she confessed. She said that appearing on TV and being subjected to the opinions of social media users contributed to her fixation on her appearance, but she was working on being more comfortable being bare-faced. The pandemic seemingly helped her in this regard. "Corona is bringing out that 'Natural' look," she joked in a May 2020 <a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;post.</p><p dir=ltr>Savannah is an open book when it comes to the cosmetic procedures she's had done. She's admitted to having two nose jobs and using fillers on her lips and face. "Let's erase this whole stigma of, whatever, just being natural," she said during an&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;beauty tutorial. "Because let's be real, there are a lot of people out here that are not natural."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>When the "Growing Up Chrisley" star shares a makeup-free selfie on Instagram, her followers often tell her how amazing she looks. She also receives a flood of responses from fans who can see a striking family resemblance between her and her father, Todd Chrisley, despite the small tweaks to her face. "STUNNING!!! but BOY OH BOY do you look like Todd here," <a href=#>read a reaction</a> to one of her fresh-faced photos. "You look just like your sweet daddy," another Instagrammer <a href=#>wrote</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5pbYVxe9ahmK1llKSytHnSmq2app6WtW6vx6ugrKSVrnqtu86kZKWhm5p6uLXToaaurF2irqyx1Klm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
