The Disney Channel never officially gave a reason as to why they let Paul go mid-season of the show, but the company did part ways just in time, as only more controversy lay on the horizon for Paul ⏤ including, but not limited to, a fake marriage and an FBI raid of his Calabasas home.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Still, the spotlight loved Paul and Paul loved the spotlight, so the Vine star-turned-actor continued to reel in more followers on YouTube, creating outrageous content that made him one of the biggest names on the platform and earning hims more money than almost any other YouTuber.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>Now 25 years old, Paul has shifted his attention to boxing, becoming one of the hottest names in the industry and earning himself the nickname “The Problem Child.” He’s garnered a five-fight winning streak that recently includes beating UFC Welterweight Champion Tyron Woodley.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>From Vine to Disney Channel all the way to YouTube and professional boxing, Paul has raked in a serious amount of dough.
