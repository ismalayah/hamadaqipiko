I mean, not only is it cool enough that Marv Wolfman and George Perez’s masterwork is being adapted to live action in the first place, but we’ll also see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no less than three Supermen</a> – played by Tom Welling, Tyler Hoechlin and Brandon Routh, respectively – united on the small screen.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>That said, it’d probably take us the rest of the day to list off each and every superhero to play some sort of role in this massive crossover event. Heck, the producers have even reached as far as securing the services of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Batman ’66 alum Burt Ward</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Birds of Prey‘s Ashley Scott</a>. If that doesn’t get across the point of how infinite Earths will be represented, I don’t know what will.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Providing our latest teaser is the unofficial Ambassador of the Arrowverse himself, Stephen Amell. This time, he posted a cool photo across various social media accounts showing he and various other co-stars posing with his daughter while being in full costume – in addition to someone who had to be blacked out.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Here’s the caption accompanying his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> post specifically, followed by the image itself:</p><p>“Supergirl, The Flash, (redacted), Batwoman, Superman & The Atom singing our daughter Happy Birthday with the entire Supergirl Crew was pretty cool. Lotta Dad Points today. Lotta Dad Points. Happy Birthday Maverick.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/amell-crisis.jpg><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Aside from how I imagine any one of us would do just about anything to take a photo with that lineup of actors, it’s the redacted person who’s getting much attention. After how many cameo roles have already been disclosed, we can only hypothesize who’s being kept under wraps. Is it Batman? Time will tell, my friends.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>Something else that caught my eye was the Atom taking time out for a photo op. Based on the height and frame, I’m pretty sure that’s Brandon Routh as Ray Palmer, and not <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the incoming Osric Chau as Ryan Choi</a>. I’m just wondering how they’re going to explain Ray and Kingdom Come Superman looking exactly alike.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=99 data-injectable=false>“<strong>Crisis on Infinite Earths</strong>” kicks off with Supergirl on Sunday, December 8th on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wMSpn56mXZa6prjLZquemaOawG652KyrnqqpYrCprdGamq2domKws7XSoqpmoZ6btq%2B1055knpmiqbW0ec%2Bhpq2nXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
