Australian billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar copped a massive blow of A$1.6 billion ($1.7b) as the market reacted badly to the duo's software group's outlook for the fiscal year.
The co-founders of NASDAQ-listed firm Atlassian, which is currently valued at A$34b, had its US-listed shares plummet overnight, falling eight per cent from US$111.19 ($166.28) to US$100.92.
